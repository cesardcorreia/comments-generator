# Comments Generator

Comments generator is a simple command to generate a style of comment.

Currently available comments styles:

* Laravel:
```
/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Comment title
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Comment description.
|
*/
```

### Currently in TODO:

* Take in consideration the indentation, tabs/spaces, of the current editor in order to apply the comment properly formated
    * The automatic selection should be based on this
* Being able to type a keywork like `laravel-comment` and hit tab to execute the command
* Remove the comment inserted alert thingy
